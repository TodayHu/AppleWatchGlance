###Glance Interfaces
A glance is a focused interface that you use to display your appâ€™s most important information. Glances are aptly named because they are intended to be looked at quickly by the user. Glances are nonscrolling; the entire glance interface must fit on a single screen. Glances are read-only and cannot contain buttons, switches, or other interactive controls. Tapping a glance launches your WatchKit app.

To create a glance, you do not have to create a separate executable. Instead, you create a specialized set of objects inside your existing WatchKit app and WatchKit extension. In fact, the classes and techniques you use to implement a glance are the same ones you use to create your WatchKit app.
